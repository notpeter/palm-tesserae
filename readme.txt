Feel free to check out the webpage for this software, http://palm.duckies.org and/or my blog http://brainsoup.duckies.org for more info on my software and me.

This software has been tested on numerous palm os roms using POSE and I have personally confirmed that it works with the following hardware devices:

Palm III
Palm IIIXE
Palm m500
Palm m505
Palm m515
Palm Zire
Palm Tungsten T
Sony Clie (a couple different models while I was at an Electronics store in germany)

It should work with any palmOS revision since 3.0 (the Palm III).  So if you have a palm that is not the original Pilot or the Pilot Pro it will probably run, and it might even run on those with the 3.0 OS update card.

Have fun, try not to hurt yourself.
