As such, this product comes with no warranty. Of any sort. No really, I ain't foolin -- if you break you palm because of my app (which shouldn't happen) it's not my fault.

Although I'm not requiring you to do this, I would appreciate that if you find any bugs, make any modifications or release software based on the code of this you would drop me an email (petree@poboxes.com) or an AIM (fruhead98) or an ICQ (8080288).  I wrote this with the intention of cleaning it up and releasing it as shareware, which I still may do, but seeing as I have spent only a couple hours working on it in the alst few years I figured I might as well release this to the public in a rough form.

Have fun!
